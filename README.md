this website was taken from a downloaded version of the inital google doc and then pruned in to separate html and css files.


<!-- need a section on editing the document -- control f since the files are so big -->
  <!-- also a note for aiding in changes, make sure to clearly note in which section the changes were made, and if there are small changes within a larger body of text, highlight specifically the changes, likely additions -->
<!-- deployment -- how it's through github pages -->
